			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p class="card gray-background">Hello, I am Cam McKay. I've worked in K12 technology for 5 years but am now switching my focus towards harnessing my software development skills. Currently I am a student at SIUE studying Computer Science and plan to graduate in May of 2026.</p>

			<h2>What is Tri-Quad?</h2>
			<p class="card gray-background">Tri-Quad.net is my portfolio website where I showcase my latest work. The name comes from a Minecraft server that I used to host from the domain in grade school.</p>

				<h2>Technical Notes</h2>
				<p>My experience is spread across several different areas. For front end, I am comfortable in HTML and CSS but am also in the process of learning React. For backend, I have built apps with PHP and MySql. When it comes to console applications, I have experience writing in Python, C++, and Java. I also have worked with Unity Engine to build games for the Nintendo 3DS and used Javascript along with HTML canvases to create games for the web. Alongside all of these I also have extensive knowledge in devopsâ€”building and deploying Docker images, running various game servers like Minecraft or Terraria, alongside running a web server and proxy.</p>

				<h2>Future Site Plans</h2>
				<p>Right now, the site is a 100% hand crafted static site that I am in the process of rewriting to be more dynamic. This will allow me to easily add entries to a dynamically rendered projects page along with simplifying updating certain elements such as the navigation bar.</p>
